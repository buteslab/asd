* [**Selective optical coatings and metamaterials**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~cvlsegmentation/cob/)<br>
Design of selective coatings for improved thermal performance for various applications such as solar thermal, solar photovoltaic, thermo-photovoltaic, buildings glazings, greenhouses and vertical farms.  These metamaterial based coatings utilize nano-particles or structures to achieve a certain spectral and directional behavior based on each application to improve performance.  Our research in this area is computational and involves modeling near and far field radiative transfer utilizing various methods for solution of radiative transport equation and Maxwell's equations with/without considering fluctuational electrodynamics.  

* [**Engineered materials for improved thermal performance**](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/mcg/)<br>
Existing materials have limitations for thermal performance and to improve engineered materials can be used.  Colloidal suspensions of nano-particles can be utilized as a working fluid for many different applications and  developing stable suspensions, understanding governing thermal enhancement mechanisms and utilizing them for different applications is of interest.  Our research in this field relies on experiments and modeling in macro-scale using CFD and in micro-scale using molecular dynamics to identify optimized engineered fluids for different applications.  

* [**Optical characterization of nano-structures**](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/~biwiproposals/seism/index.html)<br>
Optical characterization of nano-particles or their aggregates are required for many applications such as combustion diagnostics, nano-manufacturing or nano-technology based applications. Our research is computational, focusing on inferring morphological parameters defining these structures based on their light scattering behavior through solution of the inverse problem through gradient based/meta-heuristic search algorithms, Bayesian inference, and approximate Bayesian computation.   

* [**Thermal management of opto/electronic devices**](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/resources/supervised-assessment-segmentation-hierarchies)<br>
Thermal management has been a major issue for safe operation and reliability of opto/electronic devices due to increasing heat dissipation density. A holistic solution must be provided on device, level, cooling system, device and facility levels.  Our research focusing especially focusing on package and cooling system level solutions, provide innovative solutions on both ends.  

* [**Inverse design and control of thermal systems**](https://imatge.upc.edu/web/resources/supervised-assessment-segmentation-hierarchies)<br>
High temperature thermal systems are used for many manufacturing processes such as semiconductor manufacturing, annealing of glass or other materials, food processing.  Precise thermal control is required for high quality production at high yield for these systems.  Inverse design is an innovative approach formulating the design problem as an inverse problem considering the desired output and it was shown that it can be utilized for design and control of for high precision manufacturing.  Our research focuses on design, model based control using artifical intelligence/learning (AI/AL), and remote thermal sensing that is required for unintrusive monitoring of the processed systems.
